dj-battle-scoreboard
====================

a javaFX "dj battle score board" for events with several dj's...

pretty much a straight forward project to run a native style app on a macbook to visualize a dj battle score board in a 
club... this application was done for the kurhaus lenzerheide in switzerland!

the bars from the chart change colors with every reset of the votes. to increase a vote for a certain dj, just click on
its bar and the votes increase by one!

loading a csv data file: press < shift > + < ctrl > + < Enter > to open a file load dialog. an example of the csv data file you can find in the resource package (src/main/resources/data/djs.csv).

future todo's: style the app with some fancy javaFX animation shizzle! ;)

that's it, that's all for the moment! best regards,
*maesi*
